# EncDec

A simple web app for on-the-fly text encryption and decryption.

## Description

EncDec is a web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text quickly and easily without the need for third-party software. It is ideal for situations where sensitive information needs to be transmitted or stored securely.

The app uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text. All encryption and decryption processes occur client-side, so no sensitive information is stored on any servers. 

## Features

* Encrypt plain text using a key
* Decrypt encrypted text using a key
* Supports AES encryption algorithm
* No data is stored on any server

## Usage

1. Go to the [EncDec website](https://encdec.dilshann.lk)
2. Select the "Encrypt plain text" tab
3. Enter the text that you want to encrypt in the "Plain Text" field
